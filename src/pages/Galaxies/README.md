# 🌌 Galaxies

Divide the grid into symmetric galaxies around their centers.

## Category

Region Division

## How to Play

1. Divide the grid into regions (galaxies)
2. Each region has a center point (marked with a dot)
3. Each region must have 180° rotational symmetry around its center
4. Regions cannot overlap
5. All cells belong to exactly one galaxy

## Puzzle Source

**📊 Dataset**

Puzzles are loaded from a curated dataset.

## Tips & Strategy

- Centers on edges create specific symmetry constraints
- Centers on corners allow only 90° rotations
- Start with galaxies whose shape is most constrained
