Draw diagonals in cells. Numbers show how many lines meet at that point.

## Category

Loop & Path

## How to Play

1. Each cell gets exactly one diagonal (/ or \)
2. Numbers at vertices show line endpoints meeting there
3. Diagonals cannot form closed loops
4. Use the numbers to constrain diagonal directions
5. All cells must contain a diagonal

## Puzzle Source

**🔧 Generator**

Puzzles are algorithmically generated on-the-fly.

**Source:** Generated diagonal intersection puzzles

## Tips & Strategy

- 0 at a vertex: all diagonals point away
- 4 at a vertex: all diagonals point toward it
- Avoid creating closed loops as you solve
