## A.K.A.

Also known as: Sums, Sum Crossword, Sum Puzzle

## Category

Logic Puzzles

## How to Play

1. Fill white cells with numbers 1-n (where n is the grid size)
2. Each row and column must contain each number exactly once
3. Shaded cells separate the grid into groups
4. Numbers outside the grid show the sums of consecutive filled cell groups
5. Multiple clues indicate multiple groups in that row/column

## Example

If a row clue shows "6 9", that row has two groups of white cells. The first group sums to 6, the second to 9, separated by a shaded cell.

## Grid Sizes

- 5×5, 6×6, 7×7, 8×8, or 9×9

## Difficulty Levels

- **Easy**: Simpler patterns with more deducible cells
- **Medium**: Standard difficulty
- **Hard**: Complex patterns requiring advanced logic
- **Expert**: Minimal clues, maximum challenge

## Puzzle Source

**🔧 Generator**

Puzzles are algorithmically generated with guaranteed unique solutions.

**Source:** Procedural generation with difficulty grading

## Tips & Strategy

- Start with rows/columns that have a single sum clue
- Use the uniqueness constraint (each number appears once per row/column)
- Small sums are very constraining (e.g., sum of 3 can only be 1+2)
- Large sums help narrow down which numbers must be grouped together
- Process of elimination works well once some cells are filled
