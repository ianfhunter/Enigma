# ➕ Kakurasu

Fill cells so row/column sums match targets. Each cell adds its position value to the sum!

## A.K.A.

Also known as: Index Sums, Cross Sums

## Category

Classic Logic & Reasoning

## How to Play

1. Each row and column has a target sum displayed on the edges
2. Columns are numbered 1, 2, 3... from left to right
3. Rows are numbered 1, 2, 3... from top to bottom
4. When you fill a cell in column N, it adds N to that row's sum
5. When you fill a cell in row N, it adds N to that column's sum
6. Fill cells so all row and column sums match their targets

Puzzles are algorithmically generated on-the-fly.

**Source:** Generated with unique solutions (smaller grids verified for uniqueness)

## Tips & Strategy

- Start with rows/columns with very high or very low target sums
- High sums often require filling cells in high-value columns/rows
- Low sums typically need cells only in low-value columns/rows
- Cross-reference row and column constraints to eliminate possibilities
