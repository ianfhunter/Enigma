## Tips & Strategy

- Start with the more awkwardly shaped pieces (F, N, W, Z)
- Save flexible pieces (I, L, Y) for filling gaps later
- The X piece (plus shape) is very constrained - place it strategically
- Pay attention to the hole location - it affects which pieces fit nearby
- If stuck, try removing the last few pieces and trying different arrangements

## Historical Note

Pentominoes were extensively studied by mathematician Solomon Golomb, who popularized them in his 1965 book "Polyominoes." The 8×8 board with 2×2 hole is a classic puzzle configuration.
