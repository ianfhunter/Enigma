# ／ Slant

Draw slashes in cells so the vertex counts match the clues.

## Category

Loop & Path

## How to Play

1. Draw exactly one diagonal line in each cell (/ or \)
2. Numbers appear at intersections (vertices)
3. Each number shows how many line endpoints meet there
4. Lines cannot form closed loops
5. Fill all cells with valid diagonals

## Puzzle Source

**🔧 Generator**

Puzzles are algorithmically generated on-the-fly.

**Source:** Generated diagonal placement puzzles

## Tips & Strategy

- A vertex with 0 means no lines end there (all pass through)
- A vertex with 4 means all four adjacent cells point to it
- Corner and edge vertices have fewer adjacent cells
