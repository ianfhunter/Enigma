## How to Play

1. Cards are arranged in **three peaks**, each with 4 rows (30 cards total) with a draw pile (22 cards)
2. Only **exposed** cards can be selected (face-up and not covered by cards below)
3. **Draw a card** from the deck - it goes face-up on the waste pile
4. Remove cards from peaks that are **adjacent** (one rank higher or lower) to the top waste card
5. Removed cards go on top of the waste pile and become the new matching target
6. **Win** by clearing all 30 cards from the three peaks

### Adjacent Cards (wrapping)

Cards are adjacent if they differ by exactly 1 rank, wrapping around:
- A ↔ 2 ↔ 3 ↔ 4 ↔ 5 ↔ 6 ↔ 7 ↔ 8 ↔ 9 ↔ 10 ↔ J ↔ Q ↔ K ↔ A

**Examples:**
- If waste is **7**, you can remove **6** or **8**
- If waste is **A**, you can remove **2** or **K**
- If waste is **K**, you can remove **Q** or **A**

## Puzzle Source

**🎲 Generated**

Puzzles are generated using seeded random number generation. Each game uses a unique seed for reproducibility.

**⚠️ Note:** Some generated games may be unsolvable. If you get stuck, try a new game!

## Tips & Strategy

- The top card of the waste pile is always your matching target
- Look for chains: removing one card may reveal cards that match the new waste card
- Plan ahead: sometimes it's better to draw a new card before removing exposed cards
- Clear peaks strategically - clearing one peak completely can help access cards in others

## Controls

- **Click** a card from a peak to remove it (if adjacent to waste card)
- **Click** draw pile to reveal next card and add to waste pile
- **Undo** to reverse your last move
- **New Game** generates a fresh random puzzle
- **Give Up** to end the current game
